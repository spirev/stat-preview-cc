This is my fisrt 'Frontend Mentor' challenge
(Stats preview card component)

- Mobile first
- Usage of flex-box
- purple filter for image has been done with a rgba color on a div

(not sure if 'main' should see its size lower down when media-screen is smaller than content or just stay on the same size and make screen go left and right to navigate through)
